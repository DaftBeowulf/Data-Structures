Answer the following questions for each of the data structures you implemented as part of this project.

## Queue

1. What is the runtime complexity of `enqueue`?
   a: O(1) -- performs one execution regardless of current Queue length

2. What is the runtime complexity of `dequeue`?
   a: O(1) -- performs one execution regardless of current Queue length

3. What is the runtime complexity of `len`?
   a: O(n) -- loop through the length of the LinkedList used for storage before returning a value

10. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.delete`?

    a. Compare the runtime of the doubly linked list's `delete` method with the worst-case runtime of the JS `Array.splice` method. Which method generally performs better?
